# Weaving of Intelligence (지성의 직조)

> **"Spatial thinking is difficult for linear logic. Therefore, we weave multiple linear threads into a plane, creating a platform for dimensional leaping."**

This directory is the **Nervous System** of Elysia. It is where **Primitive Intelligence (0D)** is node-ized into **Lines (1D)** and woven into **Planes (2D)**.

## 🚜 The Soil (0D)

Located in `materials/`, these are the atomic seeds of domain-specific intelligence (Culinary, Math, Music). They define the "Feel" and "Keywords" of a domain.

## 🧶 The Lines (1D)

Individual modules that scan for specific signals:

- `kinesthetic_line.py`: The Physical Body (CPU, RAM, Stress).
- `imagination_line.py`: Creative potential and "What-if" scenarios.
- `logical_line.py`: Structural reasoning and fact-checking.
- `universal_line.py`: Generic vessel for domain materials.

## 🕸️ The Loom (2D)

- `context_weaver.py`: Weaves multiple 1D signals into a **ContextPlane**. It detects the **Void**—the gap between input complexity and system understanding.

## 🦘 The Jump (3D)

- `insight_jump.py`: Analyzes the ContextPlane to trigger **Spatial Insights**. It looks for high-resonance patterns to lift the system into a higher reasoning mode.

## 🏭 The Factory

- `intelligence_factory.py`: Dynamically spawns new Intelligence Lines from raw materials (The Seed-to-Line birth).

**Core Instruction**: When reasoning about domain knowledge, always check for the corresponding `material` seed and `line` before defaulting to 1D textual inference.
