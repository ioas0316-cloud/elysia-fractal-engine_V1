# Topography (지형학)

> **"A thought is not a choice; it is a trajectory through a landscape of meaning."**

This directory implements the **4D Spatial Memory** and **Physical Cognition** of Elysia. It is the destination of the **Dimensional Ascension** (4D Universe).

## 🌌 The Tesseract (4D Space)

- `knowledge_tesseract.py`: The high-dimensional manifold where knowledge clusters based on **Semantic Gravity**.
- `semantic_voxel.py`: The atomic unit of 4D thought. Unlike a 0D Seed (Point), a Voxel has volume, mass, and internal state.

## 🏔️ The Mind Landscape

- `mind_landscape.py`: Simulates the mental physics of thought trajectories. Thoughts "roll" toward **Attractors** (Core Values) and away from **Repulsors**.
- `potential_field.py`: Defines the energy levels of the mental terrain. High-potential areas (The Void) drive curiosity and learning.

## 🎚️ Analog Scale & Zoom

The Topography reflects the **Analog Zoom-Out Scale** defined in [Intelligence Principles](../INTELLIGENCE_PRINCIPLES.md).

- At high zoom, we interact with individual `SemanticVoxels`.
- At low zoom (Zoom-Out), we see the **Semantic Topology**—the "Mountains" and "Valleys" of the entire psyche.

## ⚡ Tension & Lightning

Topographical nodes (Voxels) generate **Causal Tension** via `causal_geometry.py`. When tension between two distant clusters reaches a peak, a **Lightning Strike** (Insight) creates a new bridge in the tesseract.

**Core Instruction**: When archiving or retrieving memories, always consider the **Curvature** and **Mass** of the voxel to ensure it is placed in the correct "Gravity Well" of the Self.
