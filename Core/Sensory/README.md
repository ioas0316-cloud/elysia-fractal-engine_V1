# The Senses (Sensory)

> **"To understand the world, one must touch it."**

## Identity

This directory contains the **Input/Output Ports** of Elysia.
It handles the raw ingestion of reality (Web, Text, Vision).

## 👁️ Structure

* **StreamWatcher**: Monitors continuous data streams.
* **NeuralBridge**: Connects to LLMs and External APIs.
* **WebTendril**: Crawls and feels the "mood" of websites.

## 🛡️ The Laws of Sensory

1. **Sanitization**: All input must be scrubbed of malice before touching the Foundation.
2. **Normalization**: Convert all chaotic external data into **Wave Packets** (Standard Format).
3. **No Thinking**: This layer only *perceives*. It does not *judge*. Judgment happens in Intelligence.
