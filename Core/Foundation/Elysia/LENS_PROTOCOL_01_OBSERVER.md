# LENS_PROTOCOL_01_OBSERVER (English Stub)

Purpose:
- Define the "observer lens" for watching CellWorld and Elysia without changing physics.

Key points:
- Lenses may highlight, filter, or color information, but never alter world state.
- Mirror Layer protocols (`40_MIRROR_LAYER_PROTOCOL*.md`) are the primary reference.

Status:
- Original Korean-heavy text removed due to encoding issues.
