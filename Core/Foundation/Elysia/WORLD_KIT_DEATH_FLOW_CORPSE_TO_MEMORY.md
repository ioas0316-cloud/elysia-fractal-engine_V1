# WORLD_KIT_DEATH_FLOW_CORPSE_TO_MEMORY (Archived, English Stub)

Purpose (scenario):
- Describe how death leads to corpse, grave, field changes, and memory effects in CellWorld.

Current status:
- Treated as an overlay on the base CellWorld, not as a separate world body.
- Indexed in `WORLD_KIT_INDEX.md` under the Death / Memory line.

This file is archived; for implementation details see `Project_Sophia/core/world.py`
and any active death/field rules in code.
