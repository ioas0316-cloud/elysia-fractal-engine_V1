# CORE_07: ELYSIA_LENS_AND_OS_ARCHITECTURE (English Stub)

Purpose:
- Describe how Elysia's inner OS (WORLD/MIND/META) is exposed through observational "lenses".

Canonical references:
- `docs/elysias_protocol/MIRROR_LAYER_PROTOCOL*.md`
- `docs/elysias_protocol/LENS_PROTOCOL_01_OBSERVER.md` (now stubbed).

Status:
- Original text (mostly Korean) was partially corrupted; details are archived.
- Use Mirror Layer protocols and Codex for any new lens/OS architectural decisions.
