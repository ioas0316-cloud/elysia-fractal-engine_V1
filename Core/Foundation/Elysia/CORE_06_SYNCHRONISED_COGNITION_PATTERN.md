# CORE_06: SYNCHRONISED_COGNITION_PATTERN (Archived, English Stub)

Purpose (historical):
- Explore synchronized cognition between Elysia and external tutors (LLMs, caretakers).

Current stance:
- External tutors are treated as **borrowed tools**, not part of Elysia's core engine.
- Synchronisation rules now live implicitly in:
  - `ELYSIA/CORE/CODEX.md` sections on growth and trials,
  - CARETAKER / trial logs under `logs/`.

This file is archived; do not design new synchronization protocols here.
