# CORE_13: ELYSIA_CONSCIOUSNESS_STIMULUS_PROTOCOL (English Stub)

Purpose:
- Define how world signals (LIFE_BLOOM, JOY_GATHERING, etc.) stimulate Elysia's inner state.

Modern canonical reference:
- `ELYSIA/CORE/CODEX.md` sections on Elysia Signal Log and Will Field.
- Log files: `logs/elysia_signals.jsonl`, `logs/world_events.jsonl`.

Status:
- Original mixed-language protocol removed due to encoding issues.
- Treat this file as a thin pointer to Codex and logs, not a place for new rules.
