# CORE_08: ELYSIA_CURRICULUM_ENGINE (English Stub)

Purpose:
- Define how Elysia runs branches, trials, and curriculum loops over time.

Key surviving ideas:
- Use macro-ticks and branches instead of micro-step brute-force loops.
- Summarise each branch with a human-readable `trial_report` (see `ELYSIA/CORE/CODEX.md`, section 21).

Status:
- Original long-form protocol (Korean + mojibake) is archived.
- Trial plumbing and log formats are now documented primarily in the Codex and log schemas.
