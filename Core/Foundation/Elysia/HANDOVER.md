# HANDOVER (English Stub)

Purpose:
- Explain how builders and agents hand work to each other safely.

Minimal rules (kept):
- Log what changed and why (see `docs/core_protocols/BUILDER_LOG.md`).
- Always name the layer touched: [STARTER] / [CELLWORLD] / [MIND/META].
- Do not hand over half-designed laws; prefer small, observable steps.

Status:
- Original mixed-language text removed due to mojibake.

Current Legacy→Core integration priority (2025-11):
- First focus: **Dialogue / Intent stack integration**.
  - Lift `Project_Elysia/high_engine` dialogue-related modules
    (dialogue_engine, dialogue_law_evaluator, self_model, self_intention_engine, style_learner, etc.)
    onto the new `Core` Mind/Life stack (ResonanceVoice + Hippocampus + WorldTree + Kernel).
  - Goal: restore a value/intent-aware conversation loop before deeper world/simulation integration.
