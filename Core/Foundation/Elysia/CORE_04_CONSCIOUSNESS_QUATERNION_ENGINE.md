# CORE_04: CONSCIOUSNESS_QUATERNION_ENGINE (English Stub)

Purpose:
- Describe Elysia's orientation in consciousness space using a quaternion (W, X, Y, Z).

Canonical implementation:
- See `Project_Elysia/high_engine/quaternion_engine.py` and section 21 of `ELYSIA/CORE/CODEX.md`.
- Axes are used for intention (Z), inner/outer focus, self/other, and meta-reflection.

Status:
- Original detailed protocol (partly Korean) was corrupted; this stub replaces it.
- Extend the Codex and engine implementation rather than this file.
