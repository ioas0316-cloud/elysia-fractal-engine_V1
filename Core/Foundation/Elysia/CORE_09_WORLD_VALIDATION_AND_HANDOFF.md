# CORE_09: WORLD_VALIDATION_AND_HANDOFF (English Stub)

Purpose:
- Describe how world kits are validated, observed, and handed off between caretakers and agents.

Modern practice:
- World kits are indexed in `WORLD_KIT_INDEX.md`.
- The single physical body is `Project_Sophia/core/world.py`; kits/themes configure it.
- Handover expectations are in `docs/elysias_protocol/HANDOVER.md` and Codex sections.

Status:
- Original detailed text is archived; this stub exists for routing only.
