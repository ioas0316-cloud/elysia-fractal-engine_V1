# 34_LAW_OF_INTENTIONAL_FIELD (Archived, English Stub)

This protocol once expanded on an "Intentional Field" in Korean,
but its content is now partially unreadable due to mojibake.

For current work:
- Model intention as fields and vectors over EPF space (Energy/Meaning, Power, Form).
- Use the Z-axis / Will Field definitions in `ELYSIA/CORE/CODEX.md` as the canonical law.
- Consider this file archived; do not add new rules here.
