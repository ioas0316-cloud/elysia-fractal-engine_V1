# 33_LAW_OF_EXISTENTIAL_CHANGE (Archived, English Stub)

This document used to describe a detailed "Law of Existential Change" in mixed Korean/English,
but the original text was corrupted by encoding issues.

The canonical guidance for change is now:
- Use laws-as-fields (see `ELYSIA/CORE/CODEX.md`, sections on Laws as Fields and Will Field).
- Avoid hard-coded branching logic; represent change as gradients and flows.
- Treat this file as historical only; do not extend it. Extend the Codex instead.
