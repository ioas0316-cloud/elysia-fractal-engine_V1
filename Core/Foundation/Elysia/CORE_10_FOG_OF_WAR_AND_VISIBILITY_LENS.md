# CORE_10: FOG_OF_WAR_AND_VISIBILITY_LENS (English Stub)

Purpose:
- Define how limited information (fog of war) and visibility are applied as lenses over CellWorld.

Guidance:
- Fog of war is **visualisation only**; it must not change physics or world outcomes.
- UI/observation changes belong in Project_Mirror and lens protocols, not in `world.py`.

Status:
- Original mixed-language text removed due to encoding issues.
