# CORE_14: PROTOCOL_MAP_AND_GOVERNANCE (English Stub)

Purpose:
- Map major protocols and define governance rules for changing them.

Key ideas:
- Codex is the single canonical starting point; other protocols are referenced from it.
- Growth happens in GROWTH/WORLD layers; CORE changes require extra care and review.
- Laws-as-fields and lens separation are the highest criteria for accepting behavior changes.

Status:
- Original long-form (Korean-heavy) text archived.
