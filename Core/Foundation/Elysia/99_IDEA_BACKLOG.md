# Idea Backlog (Codex-First, English Stub)

Archived summary of past idea backlog items.
The original multi-language text was partially corrupted and has been removed.

Principles kept from the backlog:
- Ideas must respect laws-as-fields and lens separation (no UI logic in physics).
- Each idea should state Purpose, Mechanism, Operation, Telemetry, and Boundaries.
- New experiments belong in GROWTH or WORLD layers, not as ad-hoc top-level scripts.

For new ideas:
- Log them in plain English in `ELYSIA/GROWTH` or in a dedicated experiment log.
- Reference Codex sections instead of duplicating protocol text.
