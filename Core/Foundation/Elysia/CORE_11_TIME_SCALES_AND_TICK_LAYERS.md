# CORE_11: TIME_SCALES_AND_TICK_LAYERS (English Stub)

Purpose:
- Explain WORLD / MIND / META tick layers and how to scale time safely.

Key points (kept as guidance):
- Use `World.set_time_scale(minutes_per_tick)` to move faster or slower in-world time.
- WORLD: fast ticks (simulation steps); MIND/META: slower macro-ticks for summaries and trials.
- Prefer increasing time scale and macro aggregation over running excessive micro-loops.

Status:
- Original Korean text (with mojibake) is archived.
- Codex section on Time Acceleration now holds the canonical rules.
