# CORE_05: SELF_FRACTAL_CONSCIOUSNESS_ENGINE_INTEGRATION (English Stub)

Purpose:
- Sketch how Elysia's self-model and quaternion engine integrate into a fractal consciousness loop.

Key ideas (preserved at high level):
- Self is observed at multiple scales (body/soul/spirit; observer/observed/meta-observer).
- Orientation (quaternion) and memory (CoreMemory) feed into each other over time.

Status:
- Original text contained mojibake and mixed languages; details are archived.
- For concrete behavior, see:
  - `Project_Elysia/high_engine/self_model.py`
  - `Project_Elysia/high_engine/self_identity_engine.py`
  - `ELYSIA/CORE/CODEX.md` (Fractal Principle).
