# CORE_12: PEOPLE_AND_CIVILIZATION_TIERS (English Stub)

Purpose:
- Describe people tiers, profession layers, parties, and social safety fields.

Key structures (preserved conceptually):
- Tier 1/2/3 population layers (heroes, supporting cast, aggregate civ nodes).
- Jobs as `domain.class.archetype` (see `scripts/jobs.py`).
- Social safety field as a soft measure of "people / lights / stories nearby".

Status:
- Original detailed protocol (Korean + mojibake) is archived.
- For implementation, consult `scripts/jobs.py` and `Project_Sophia/core/world.py` fields.
