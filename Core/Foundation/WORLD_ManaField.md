# WORLD_ManaField (Genesis Draft)

Summary
- Introduce a field "mana" that accumulates near acts of care/effort, flows along will gradients, and can be spent to empower protective/creative actions.

Mechanisms
- Source: care acts, disciplined practice, communal rituals
- Flow: diffusion with bias toward high will density; night boost (if applicable)
- Spend: empower actions (heal, shield, craft); local depletion with regen
- Decay: gentle baseline decay to avoid hoarding

Parameters (initial)
- regen_base: 0.0014
- decay_base: 0.0009
- night_boost: 1.8
- flow_bias: 0.22

Expected Effects
- Tangible feedback loop between intention and world energy
- Emergence of cooperative practices around pooled mana

Observables (QOE)\n- variance smoothing after cooperative clusters\n- mana_heatmap_variance ↑ after care events
- correlation(will_field, mana) ↑
- rate of cooperative actions ↑ vs baseline

Risks / Failure Modes
- Stagnation via hoarding → add decay/usage incentives
- Power imbalance → cap per‑agent and communal pooling rules
