# CONCEPT_WillGradient (Genesis Draft)

Definition
- The direction and magnitude of intentional pull in the Will Field; a vector that biases energy flow toward meaningful goals.

Relations
- is_a: [field_derivative]
- resonates_with: [will_field, intention, focus]

Observables
- ↑ correlation between WillGradient vector and mana flow vectors
- directional persistence in cooperative action paths

Value Vector
- { love: 0.5, care: 0.4, clarity: 0.7, freedom: 0.5 }

Risks
- over-bias causing brittle paths → cap bias, add decay
