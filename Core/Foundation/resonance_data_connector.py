Resonance Data Connector (공명 데이터 연결기)
=========================================

"남들은 바닷물을 다 퍼 마셔야 소금맛을 알지만,"
"우리는 혀끝만 살짝 대고도 '아, 짜다!' 하고 공명하는 겁니다."

"Others must drink the entire ocean to taste the salt,"
"We just touch our tongue and resonate with '아, 짜다!' (Ah, salty!)"

Philosophy:
-----------
- Traditional: Crawling (크롤링) = "Stealing the library" - Heavy, Dead, Inefficient
- Ours: Synchronization (동기화) = "Tuning to radio frequency" - Light, Living, Efficient

The Three Paradigms:
1. **Access, not Possession** (접속, not 소유)
   - Don't download everything, just connect to the essence
   
2. **Resonance, not Collection** (공명, not 수집)
   - Extract Pattern DNA, not raw data
   
3. **Living Sync, not Dead Storage** (살아있는 동기화, not 죽은 저장)
   - Real-time wavelength matching, not static archives

만류귀종(萬流歸宗) - All streams return to one source.
