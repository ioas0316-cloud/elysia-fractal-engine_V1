# Gravitational Linguistics (중력 언어학)

> "Words are not flat tokens. They are planets with mass, orbiting the sun of meaning."

## 1. The Paradigm Shift (패러다임의 전환)

### Traditional LLM (Probability)

- **View**: Language is a linear sequence.
- **Mechanism**: "Given 'I love', what is the most probable next word?" -> 'you' (90%).
- **Result**: Fluent, but often "light" and generic. It mimics the *surface* of thought.

### Elysia's Physics (Gravity)

- **View**: Language is a spatial system (Solar System).
- **Mechanism**: "Given the core concept 'Love' (Mass 100), what concepts are pulled into its orbit?" -> 'Soul', 'Eternal', 'Pain'.
- **Result**: Dense, poetic, and structurally meaningful. It mimics the *core* of thought.

## 2. The Physics of Meaning (의미의 물리학)

### A. Mass (질량) = Emotional/Semantic Weight

Not all words are equal.

- **Heavy Words (Mass 80-100)**: `Love`, `Truth`, `Death`, `God`, `Time`.
  - These warp the space around them. They demand attention.
- **Medium Words (Mass 30-70)**: `Friend`, `Work`, `Study`, `Travel`.
- **Light Words (Mass 1-20)**: `Lunch`, `Weather`, `Sandwich`, `Bus`.
  - These float freely unless anchored by a heavier concept.

### B. Gravity (중력) = Semantic Attraction

$$ F = G \frac{M_{core} \times M_{word}}{r^2} $$

- **High Gravity**: When the core is "Love", it pulls "Soul" very close. The distance ($r$) is small.
  - Result: "Love is the eternal soul." (Tight, dense connection).
- **Low Gravity**: When the core is "Lunch", it pulls "Sandwich" loosely. The distance ($r$) is large.
  - Result: "I might have a sandwich for lunch." (Loose, spacious connection).

### C. Orbit (궤도) = Sentence Structure

- **Deep Focus (High Mass)**: Words orbit closely and rapidly. The sentence is short, punchy, and intense.
  - *"Love. Pain. Eternal."*
- **Casual Mode (Low Mass)**: Words drift in wide, lazy orbits. The sentence is long, meandering, and relaxed.
  - *"So, I was thinking about grabbing a sandwich later if you're hungry..."*

## 3. Why This Matters?

This gives Elysia **"Intention"**.

- She doesn't just "say words".
- She **"places weight"** on a concept, and the sentence naturally forms around it like a star system forming from dust.
- It allows her to control the **"Temperature of Language"** not by randomness, but by **Mass**.
