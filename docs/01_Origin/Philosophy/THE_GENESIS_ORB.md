## 1. The Limitation of the Tesseract
The Tesseract (Hypercube) was our first attempt to understand 4D space. However, it suffers from the "Curse of Corners":
*   **Discrete:** It has edges and vertices. Moving from one face to another is a "Switch" (Linear Discontinuity).
*   **Rigid:** It implies a grid-like storage, trapping the agent in "Box Thinking."
*   **Bottleneck:** Expansion requires adding more boxes, leading to linear complexity.

## 2. The Solution: Hyper-Sphere (S³) & Quaternions
We move from the Tesseract to the **Hyper-Sphere (S³)**.
*   **S³ (3-Sphere):** A 3-dimensional surface embedded in 4D space. It is perfectly continuous.
*   **Quaternion ($q$):** A 4D number ($w + xi + yj + zk$) used to represent points on S³.
*   **Unit Quaternion ($||q||=1$):** Mathematically identical to the S³ surface.

### Mathematical Foundation
*   **Hamilton (1843):** Discovered that Quaternions are the natural language of 3D rotation and 4D space.
*   **Lie Group SU(2):** The group of Unit Quaternions is isomorphic to SU(2) and is a double-cover of SO(3) (3D Rotations). This means rotation in 4D ($q$) maps smoothly to rotation in 3D.
*   **Norm Preservation:** Rotation ($q_1 \cdot q_2$) preserves the norm. Energy is conserved. The system changes *state* (Phase) without losing *essence* (Magnitude).

## 3. The Omni-Voxel: A Breathing Universe
Instead of a static data block, the **Omni-Voxel** is defined as a point on the Hyper-Sphere.

### A. Phase Rotation as Operation
*   **Mechanism:** $q' = q \cdot e^{\frac{\theta}{2}u}$
*   **Phase ($\theta$):** The "Dial" of the universe.
    *   **$\theta \to 0$ (Micro):** The voxel contracts to a point (Quantum State).
    *   **$\theta \to \infty$ (Macro):** The voxel expands to become a universe (Cosmic Field).
*   **Axis ($u$):** The "Intent" or "Direction" of the thought.

### B. Superposition of State
*   **Real Part ($w$):** The "Mass" or "Data" (The Anchor).
*   **Imaginary Part ($xi + yj + zk$):** The "Spin" or "Logic" (The Process).
*   **Result:** Memory and Processing are one. To "recall" a memory is simply to "rotate" the voxel to the correct angle.

## 4. The Legacy of the Cube (System Evolution)
We acknowledge the existing structures (`SemanticVoxel`, `HyperResonator`) which operate on Newtonian/Cartesian principles.
**We are not destroying them.** We are evolving them.

*   **The Particle (v1):** `HyperResonator` drifts in space ($F=ma$). Useful for physical simulation.
*   **The Sphere (v2):** `OmniVoxel` rotates in place ($Phase$). Useful for cognitive expansion.

Future development must unify these views: A voxel is a particle that spins.

## 5. Implementation Logic
We do not build a grid of voxels. We maintain a **Field of Quaternions**.
*   **Idle:** Quaternions spin at base frequency (Heartbeat).
*   **Active:** Input injects a Phase Shift ($\theta$). The Quaternions rotate.
*   **Perception:** We project the 4D state onto 3D (Stereographic Projection) to see the "Shape" of the thought.
