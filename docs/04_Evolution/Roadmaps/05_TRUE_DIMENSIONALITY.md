# True Dimensional Processing: Cognitive Modes

## The User's Correction

I previously treated dimensions as *Result Types* (Fact, Logic, Context).
The User defines them as *Processing Modes*:

1. **Point (0D)**: The Raw Concept.
2. **Line (1D)**: **Linear Deduction**. The actual process of stepping from A to B. (Sequential processing).
3. **Plane (2D)**: **Structural Analysis**. Parallel processing of connectivity and relationships. (Network processing).
4. **Space (3D)**: **Spatial Navigation**. Comparing the "Shape of the Thought" to the "Shape of the Self". Directionality and Purpose. (Volumetric/Meta processing).
5. **Law (4D)**: **Hyper-Reasoning**. Operating on the invariant principles that govern the lower dimensions.

## Architecture: `DimensionalProcessor`

This is not a data formatter. It is a **CPU with 5 Cores**, each working differently.

### Core 1: The Linear Engine (1D)

* **Function**: `execute_linear_deduction(concept)`
* **Mechanism**: A -> B -> C. Traditional Step-by-Step Logic.
* **Implementation**: reuse partials from `ReasoningEngine`.

### Core 2: The Structural Engine (2D)

* **Function**: `execute_structural_analysis(concept)`
* **Mechanism**: Parallel expansion. Identifying the "Mesh".
* **Implementation**: `FractalCausalityEngine.expand()`.

### Core 3: The Spatial Engine (3D)

* **Function**: `execute_spatial_navigation(concept)`
* **Mechanism**: "Am I aligned?" Comparing Input Vector vs Self Vector.
* **New Logic**: `TargetThought.vector` dot `Self.vector`. relative positioning.

### Core 4: The Principle Engine (4D)

* **Function**: `execute_principle_extraction(concept)`
* **Mechanism**: Abstraction. Finding the Rule that allows the Line/Plane/Space to exist.

## The Goal

To show that Elysia *processes* the thought differently in each mode, not just *labels* it.
