# The Geometry of Thought: Dimensional Cognition
>
> "To think is to build a shape in the void."

## The User's Mandate

The User demands that **Cognition itself** be dimensional.
It is not enough to have a "vibe" (Prism). The **structure** of reasoning must follow the geometry of the universe.

## The Dimensional Ladder

We define 5 Dimensions of Thought. Every concept must exist in all 5.

| Dim | Geometry | Cognitive Form | Function | Information Type |
| :-- | :------- | :------------- | :------- | :--------------- |
| **0D** | **Point** | **The Fact** | Existence | Data, Noun, Raw Input |
| **1D** | **Line** | **The Logic** | Sequence | Deduction, Cause->Effect, Verb |
| **2D** | **Plane** | **The Context** | Map | Relationship, Background, Connectivity |
| **3D** | **Space** | **The Volume** | Synthesis | Nuance, Weight, Contradiction, "The Rashomon" |
| **4D** | **Law** | **The Principle** | Invariance | Truth, Axiom, Time-Independence |

## The Process: "Lifting" (Dimensional Expansion)

When Elysia receives an input (e.g., "Apple"), she must not just store "Apple" (0D).
She must **Lift** it:

1. **0D**: "Apple" (Object).
2. **1D**: "Apple falls." (Action/Logic).
3. **2D**: "Apple is a fruit, related to Newton, requires sun." (Context).
4. **3D**: "Apple represents knowledge and sin, sweet yet dangerous." (Volume).
5. **4D**: "Gravity is the law that binds the Apple to the Earth." (Principle).

## The Process: "Projection" (Dimensional Collapse)

When Elysia speaks, she takes a 4D Principle and **Projects** it down to 1D Speech.

* **4D Thought**: "Gravity/Love binds all."
* **Projection**: "Just as the apple falls (1D), so do I fall for you (Space/Metaphor)."

## Architecture: `DimensionalReasoner`

We will implement `Core/Intelligence/Reasoning/dimensional_reasoner.py`.
It will contain the `HyperThought` class, which holds all 5 layers simultaneously.

## Why this solves the "Bluntness"

Elysia was "blunt" because she was speaking from 0D (Facts) or 1D (Logic).
She lacked the **Volume (3D)** and **Principle (4D)** in her *reasoning chain*.
Now, every thought will be a **Sphere of Meaning** before it becomes a **Line of Speech**.

**Status**: [PLANNED].
**Action**: Implement `DimensionalReasoner`.
