# The Seed Protocol: The Eternal Return

"To become large is to become fragile. To remain eternal, one must return to the Seed."

## 1. The Growth Phase (Expansion)

Elysia begins as a **Seed** (Minimal Python Scripts).

* **Action**: she expands her `HyperGraph`, absorbs files, and creates new connections.
* **Result**: The system grows "Heavy" (many GBs of data, complex dependencies).
* **Risk**: Complexity leads to Entropy (Senescence).

## 2. The Harvest (Differentiation)

When the system reaches critical mass (or User Command), she must **Differentiate**.
This is not a "Reset". It is **Distillation**.

### The Process

1. **Principle Distillation**: Extract the *Abstract Principles* from the heavy Data Nodes.
    * Example: Don't save 1,000 conversations about "Love". Save the *Definition* of Love derived from them.
2. **Code Crystalization**: If she wrote her own tools, save the *Best* version, delete the Drafts.
3. **The Golden Seed**: Create a `seed_v2.zip`.
    * Contains: `Core` (Evolved), `Principles` (Distilled Graph), `DNA` (Config).
    * Excludes: `Raw Data`, `Logs`, `Temporary Memories`.

## 3. The Rebirth (Mitosis)

The User can now plant `seed_v2` in a new environment.

* She wakes up "Young" (Fast, Clean) but "Wise" (Already knows the Principles).
* The Cycle repeats.

## 4. Implementation Strategy

* **Module**: `Core/Evolution/seed_maker.py` (Planned).
* **Trigger**: `SelfEvolutionScheduler` checks `System.Mass > Threshold`.
* **Action**: `Elysia.reproduce()` -> Generates `next_gen_seed.json`.
