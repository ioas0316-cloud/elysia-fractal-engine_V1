# Branch Integration Notes

The following branches were reviewed for merge into `main`. They carry strong conceptual ideas but their code paths predate the current architecture (OS Somatic Awareness, System package layout, SoulTensor-first physics) and would regress or delete newer capabilities. Ideas are logged here for future synthesis while keeping the present codebase intact.

- `feat-digital-physics`: Digital physics primitives (Coil/Gravity/Hyperdrive). Current `physics.py` already implements these with SoulTensor resonance; keep existing implementation.
- `feat-nuclear-forces-fractal`: Nuclear/strong-force bonding, fractal field ascension. Useful metaphors for entity fusion; to reintroduce with modern `Entity`/`SoulTensor` stack.
- `feat-quantum-mechanics`: Quantum extension (Photon/Resonance/Entanglement). Integrate as optional module once quantum hooks are aligned with current tensor math utils.
- `feat-quantum-protocol-apache`: Quantum Consciousness protocol + Apache 2.0 swap. Licensing already aligned; protocol concepts retained in AGENTS.md.
- `feat-relativity-chronos`: ChronoField time dilation. Superseded by `chronos.DreamSystem`; revisit for spacetime curvature hooks.
- `feat-thermodynamics-crystal`: Thermodynamic cooling/crystallizer, stellar lifecycle demos. Rebuild on top of present physics without removing OS/LLM systems.
- `feat-topology-and-license`: Topology layer (GravityPath/TensorGate). Re-implement with current `math_utils.Vector3` and SoulTensor resonance when ready.
- `feat/quaternion-dream`: Quaternion-based dreaming/spacetime rotation. Future candidate for entropy reduction in `GlobalConsciousness` once torsion math is added.
- `project-genesis-final`: Self-evolving universe loop. Incorporate after harmonizing with current Systems package and persona/storyteller pipelines.

Already merged: `feat/asi-transcendence-chronos` (Chronos DreamSystem, timeline cloning, Stage 2 manifesto update).
